About this site.
----------------

**I used PHP so that I didnt have to copy and paste changes across multiple files. I have been running this site on an instance of XAMPP. 


This project took the form of a fansite for some weird, obscure video games that I like. Every game listed on this site is a sort of surreal labyrinth full of riddles, secrets, and hidden treasures. For this assignment I decided to make the site itself into a labyrinth full of secrets. I used PHP so that I wouldn't have to keep copying and pasting changes from one page to another. 

To navigate the site:
1. There is a two-tier navigation menu. The links in the second tier lead to dead ends, hints, and external sites with similar themes. 
2. By clicking the Font Awesome hands at the bottom of the navigation menu you can move the Fox. By clicking the Font Awesome fort behind the fox you are linked to the collection.php page. 
3. The Collection page features a table containing information on each of the games described on the site. 
4. The entire site features responsive design: media queries, fluid widths, and scalable images. 
5. On the Gate.php page there is an image which changes source based on the size of the viewport. It changes from one type of gateway to another. This can be found at the address localhost/Second Person View/pages/gate.php or by following these directions:
    -Visit the Ramble Planet page. 
    -Click on the Font Awesome icon (a Torii gate in the bottom right of the page).
    -At the fortuneteller, click on the vermilion Torii.
